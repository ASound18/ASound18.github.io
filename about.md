### ...my profile pic

As a fan of [Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama), my favorite character is [Fry](http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Philip_J._Fry_I), which explains my profile pic. My second favorite is [Bender](http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Bender_Bending_Rodr%C3%ADguez), which is the profile pic of my best friend by the way.

### ...me

I'm a professional quantitative analyst. I started my career as **Financial Economist** at [Fannie Mae](http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/index.html) - the largest purchasers of mortgages on the secondary market in the world :house_with_garden:. After working there for almost 3 years I moved back to Shanghai, China where I am currently working at [AIG](http://www.aig.com/) Shanghai Analytics Center(SAC). Besides machine learning, I spend most of time in algorithm trading strategies.
